# Accessible Ecomm

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It was created as a initiative to make ecomm accessible. It's like a study.

We will approach the best practices to create accessible components based on the technical recommendations of W3C.
